## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Software Engineer from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil

âš¡ I got bitten by the software development bug (ha!) at the age of 13, when I first started tinkering with open-source MMORPG server emulators, and eventually began developing professionally in my 20s. 

My enthusiasm extends to domain-driven design (DDD), software architecture and system design, distributed systems(and all the challenges they entail!), and a strong commitment to code quality.
